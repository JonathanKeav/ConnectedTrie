# ConnectedTrie
A data structure for efficient matching of two strings to the longest pair of prefixes

This data structure is based on the trie or prefix tree. It was created to facilitate the matching of a pair of strings to entities that are lookup-able by matching to the longest pair of prefixes. The data structure consists of two tries, the A-Trie (orange) and B-Trie (blue), with linkages between the leaf notes. The leaf nodes of the B-Trie and the the A-Trie are connected by sharing the same entity. Therefore when checking if a particular pair of strings match to an entity we traverse the B-Trie to find the entity with the longest mathcing B-string and then “climb” backup the A-Trie to reach the hearoot node. If we are successful then the entity is matched and we have the longest B-string and then the longest A-string in the set of entities. If not we traverse back up the B-Trie, and at each entity we find, we again try to “climb” backup the A-Trie to reach the root node. If we never get to the A-Trie root node no matches are found.

Above is an image that will demonstrate the lookup process. Given the entities shown in the image, and given an A-string of “cantxyz” and a B-string of “dontxyz” we would traverse the B-Trie down four nodes, “d”, “o”, ”n” and “t”. We cannot descend any further so we move to the connected leaf node in the A-Trie and try to “climb” to the root node. The first check will fail as the node contains the character “d” and the 5th character in the ANumber “cantxyz” is “x”. We are comparing the 5th character as the “d” node is 5 deep in the ANumebr trie and therefore should be matched to the 5th character. As we did not make a match with the “could-dont” entity we move back up the B-Trie from the current node “t” to ”n” and then “o”. “o” is a leaf node as it has an entity so we move to the connected leaf node in the A-Trie and try to “climb” to the root node. This time the climb from “t” to “n” to “a” and finally to “c” is successful. And we consider A-String of “cantxyz” and a B-string of “dontxyz” as matched to the “cant:do” entity.
